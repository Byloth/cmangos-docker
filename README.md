## Getting Started

All has been built aim to be as simple as possible.  
That's why, just following this few steps you'll be able to
run your CMaNGOS server without need any further configuration.

### Building all the required images

This may take a while, depending on your computer performance and your internet connection.  
Please be patient.

**CMaNGOS Builder**

```sh
cd builder/
./build.sh
```

**CMaNGOS Runner**

```sh
cd runner/
./build.sh
```

### Extracting files from the WoW client

Make sure you've already created your enviroment file in
the root of this project with the following content:

```sh
# .env
#

WOW_CLIENT_DIR="</path/to/your/wow/client>"
```

Then, simply run the following command, follow the instructions and wait:

```sh
cd builder/
./run.sh extract
```

### Managing the database

#### Initializing the database

`# TODO: write a decent description for here on...`

```bash
docker-compose up mariadb
```

```bash
cd builder/
./run.sh init-db
```

#### Backing up the database

```bash
docker-compose up mariadb
```

```bash
cd builder/
./run.sh backup-db --all > cmangos-backup.tar.gz
```

#### Restoring the database

```bash
docker-compose up mariadb
```

```bash
cd builder/
./run.sh restore-db < cmangos-backup.tar.gz
```
#### Updating the database

```bash
docker-compose up mariadb
```

```bash
cd builder/
./run.sh update-db
```

### Starting the server

```bash
./start-server.sh
```

### Creating a new account

```
account create [username] [password]
```

#### Enabling expansion for an account

```
account set addon [username] [0 to 1]
```

0. Basic version
1. The Burning Crusade
<!-- 2. Wrath of the Lich King -->


#### Setting GM level for an account

```
account set gmlevel [username] [0 to 3]
```

0. Player
1. Moderator
2. Game Master
3. Administrator

### Stopping the server

```
.server shutdown [delay]
```

`delay`: number of seconds

## Roadmap

- [ ] Adding the details of CMaNGOS and database version that generate the `.tar.gz` backup file right inside of it. 

- [ ] Adding a GitHub Action to run an automatic Docker build on each commit, while also publishing the built Docker image.  
This will allow anyone to simply download a ready-to-use Docker image, instead of building it on their machine.

- [ ] Adding a Docker build argument that allows to specify the version (`classic`, `tbc`, `wotlk`) you want to build.  
Right now, the only supported version is **`tbc`**.

- [ ] Adding as one or more specific Docker containers the application to easily manage the server, allowing new user to sign-up, view profiles, all player characters an so on...
